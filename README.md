# Miwi

This package is the beginnings of a full-stack, cross-framework meta-framework. It's my attempt to build an app development system the way I think it should work. It is essentially in pre-alpha. Feel free to experiment, but don't rely on it at all yet. It will change drastically in the coming months.

## miwi/b-x

A reimagining of html and css that just works every time. Or at least eventually it will. It's well under way, but still has plenty of rough edges.

## miwi/ui

Doesn't have anything yet, but eventually will have our collection of components, along with a system for theming.

## miwi/orm

A prototype reactive, full-stack, cross-backend, cross-frontend orm. Right now it only works with Firestore, but that will change.
